## Conclusion of brainstorming. 
We settled on a Game briefly considering a hangman app and noughts and crosses and a trivia app but came to the understanding that these three concepts could get very complicated very quickly so out of the three we chose a trivia app because we could break it down into a simple concept and the possibility that we could use one standard code that we can repeat until all questions are answered.
